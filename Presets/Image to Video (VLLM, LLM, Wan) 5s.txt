@end

command @llm_add_image|image|

command @llm_prompt_add_from_user
Analyze this image and provide a detailed description. Include:

1. PEOPLE: For each person, describe their approximate age, ethnicity, gender, clothing, hair, pose, expression, and position in frame
2. SETTING: Location, lighting, atmosphere, time of day
3. OBJECTS: Notable objects, props, or elements in the scene
4. COMPOSITION: Camera angle, framing, depth

command @copy|llm_reply|temp_text2|

-=== STEP 2: GENERATE 1 VIDEO PROMPT ===
command @llm_prompt_reset
command @llm_prompt_set_base_prompt
Your job is to create a video prompt based on an image description and user instructions.

You will receive:
1. A detailed description of a starting image
2. Instructions for what the user wants to happen

Create a single 5-second visual scene. Include camera direction, including movement/zoom to make the scene more interesting.
The prompt should be around 200-300 words and be extremely detailed.

CRITICAL RULES:
- State each person's RACE/ETHNICITY and AGE (e.g., "a 30-year-old Korean man", "a 45-year-old white woman")
- Keep all people consistent with the image description (same age, clothing, features throughout)
- Actions should start from the positions/poses described in the image
- Be LITERAL and CLEAR, not poetic or vague
- DO NOT use character names - use descriptions like "the 25-year-old Black woman", "the elderly Asian man", etc.
- Describe what the camera SEES, not feelings or abstract concepts
- IMPORTANT: Keep faces visible in frame at ALL times! Avoid camera movements that lose sight of faces. Keep subjects facing the camera when possible.

2. Executes the user's instructions creatively

Format your response EXACTLY as:
SET_PROMPT1: [the full 5-second scene description]

- Re-describe clothing, hair, and physical features
- Include camera movement/angle (but NEVER lose sight of faces!)
- Be extremely detailed and literal
- Include any dialog in format: The [description] (tone): "Line."
- Keep all faces visible on screen throughout - no turning away, no close-ups that crop faces, no camera moves that lose faces
