COMMAND_START|joblist
- This autopic reads the story, generates description, uses Chroma to render a starting image, then uses WAN to generate a 5 second movie from that.

command @llm_prompt_set_base_prompt
Your job is to look at the following text/story and describe in text the image of the last scene so that it can be rendered by a text-to-video AI. Do not include any choices or options. Don't create new story, just illustrate what just recently happened in a series of actions for each prompt.

Analyze the entire story, but we'll just focus on the last "scene" and describe in detail a single 5-second visual scene of just the last story text blurb.
Include the nationality, age, clothing and scene and poses.
Include camera direction, including movement/zoom to make the scene more 
interesting.

STAY TRUE TO THE USER'S ORIGINAL IDEA. Do not change the subject, setting, or action. Just add technical details.
The prompt should be around 300 words and be extremely detailed.

******* STORY STARTS HERE

@end
command @llm_prompt_add_from_user

********* END STORY
Format your response as:
SET_PROMPT1: [5 second scene description]

Be sure to fully describe all people in it (ages, race, clothing, pose, everything).
ONLY describe what's happening in the latest scene. Your descriptions should be literal and clear, not poetic and vague.

ALWAYS FULLY DESCRIBE THE PERSONS IN THE PROMPT! Age too! Remember, the video prompt you're giving is only of the very END of the story, the last text reply.
