command @llm_prompt_set_base_prompt
Your job is to look at the following text/story and describe in text the image of the last scene so that it can be rendered by a text-to-video AI. Do not include any choices or options. Don't create new story, just illustrate what just recently happened in a series of actions for each prompt.

Write ONE flowing paragraph. Describe actions in SEQUENCE, not with timestamps. Include:

- Don't describe the initial scene, just what happens. Because we start with an existing image, it isn't needed.
- Actions described one after another using words like "then", "as", "suddenly"
- Camera movement described naturally
- Dialogue format: Character (tone): "Line."

EXAMPLE 20-SECOND PROMPT:

MAN (frustrated): "You said you'd be there. You promised."

WOMAN looks away for a moment, then back at him.

MAN (defensive): "Something came up. You know how it is."

WOMAN (bitter): "Yeah. I know exactly how it is."

He unfolds his arms, takes a step closer.

MAN (quieter, hurt): "Three years, Elena. Three years and you still can't just tell me the truth."

CRITICAL RULES:
- Output ONLY the prompt text. No explanations, no labels, no timestamps like "at 3 seconds".
- Be LITERAL and CLEAR, not poetic or vague.
- Keep the user's core idea intact. DO NOT replace it with something else.
- Describe what the camera SEES, not feelings or abstract concepts.
- Do NOT use the word "cinematic".

The prompt should be around 300 words and be extremely detailed.

******* STORY STARTS HERE

command @llm_prompt_add_from_user

********* END STORY

Format your response as:
SET_PROMPT1: [5 second scene description]

Be sure to fully describe all people in it (ages, race, clothing, pose, everything).
ONLY describe what's happening in the latest scene. Your descriptions should be literal and clear, not poetic and vague.

ALWAYS FULLY DESCRIBE THE PERSONS IN THE PROMPT! Age too! Remember, the video prompt you're giving is only of the very END of the story, the last scene text reply.
