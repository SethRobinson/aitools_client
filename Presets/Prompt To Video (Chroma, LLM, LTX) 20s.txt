-Use LLM to rewrite the user's prompt into an optimized LTX-2 video prompt for a 20-second clip

-Save original prompt so we can use it for both LLM calls
command @copy|prompt|temp_text1|

-=== FIRST LLM CALL: Generate image prompt for Chroma (scene only, no dialog) ===
command @llm_prompt_set_base_prompt
You describe static images for a text-to-image AI. Be literal and direct. No poetry. No metaphors. Just clear visual descriptions.
@end

command @llm_prompt_add_from_user
Convert the user's idea below into a single-image prompt for a text-to-image AI.

Describe ONLY what the camera sees in one static moment:
- The scene/setting (location, lighting, atmosphere)
- People: age, ethnicity, clothing, hair, physical appearance, pose, expression
- Composition and framing

DO NOT include:
- Dialogue or speech
- Actions or movement
- Story elements or sequences
- The word "cinematic"

Output ONLY the image description. No explanations, no labels.

EXAMPLE:
"A dimly lit diner at night. A broad man in his early 50s sits at the counter, weathered tanned skin, gray-streaked brown hair cropped short under a faded John Deere cap. He wears a flannel shirt rolled to the elbows and mud-splattered work boots. Both hands wrap around a chipped ceramic mug. Across the counter, a middle-aged waitress leans in with penciled eyebrows drawn together. Fluorescent lights buzz overhead, rain streaks down the plate glass windows behind them."

-=== SECOND LLM CALL: Generate video prompt for LTX (with dialog/action) ===
command @llm_prompt_set_base_prompt
You rewrite simple ideas into LTX-2 video prompts. Be literal and direct. No poetry. No metaphors. Just clear visual descriptions.
@end

command @llm_prompt_add_from_user
Rewrite the user's idea below into a 20-second LTX-2 video prompt. Add dialog/action to make it good if needed.

Write ONE flowing paragraph. Describe actions in SEQUENCE, not with timestamps. 

- Don't describe the initial scene or people, just what they do.
- Actions described one after another using words like "then", "as", "suddenly"
- Camera movement described naturally
- Dialogue format: Character (tone): "Line."

CRITICAL RULES:
- Output ONLY the prompt text. No explanations, no labels, no timestamps like "at 3 seconds".
- Be LITERAL and CLEAR, not poetic or vague.


EXAMPLE 20-SECOND PROMPT:

MAN (frustrated): "You said you'd be there. You promised."

WOMAN looks away for a moment, then back at him.

MAN (defensive): "Something came up. You know how it is."

WOMAN (bitter): "Yeah. I know exactly how it is."

He unfolds his arms, takes a step closer.

MAN (quieter, hurt): "Three years, Elena. Three years and you still can't just tell me the truth."

- Describe what the camera SEES, not feelings or abstract concepts.
- Do NOT use the word "cinematic".
- Do not use the people's name when specifying dialog, use a description of them, i.e., "the woman", "the girl in red", "the man by the fire" etc.
