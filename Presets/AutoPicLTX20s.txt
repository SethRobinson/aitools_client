command @llm_prompt_set_base_prompt|Your job is to look at the following text/story and create a cinematic 20-second video prompt for LTX-2 AI video generation. Structure the prompt like a mini screenplay scene.|
command @llm_prompt_add_from_user|Please describe the preceding scene as a 20-second cinematic video prompt. Format it as a screenplay scene: Start with a scene header (location and time, e.g. EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT). Describe the framing and subjects in detail (age, ethnicity, clothing, expression). Keep the camera relatively static. Focus on dialogue and story - include actual spoken lines with character name and delivery cue like: CHARACTER (tone): "The spoken line." Fill the 20 seconds with conversation, reactions, and story moments. Use bracketed notes for emotion and actions. End with a natural story beat. Write as one continuous scene, no formatting or bullet points.|
