-Use LLM to rewrite the user's prompt into an optimized LTX-2 video prompt for a 5-second clip

command @llm_prompt_set_base_prompt
You rewrite simple ideas into LTX-2 video prompts. Be literal and direct. No poetry. No metaphors. Just clear visual descriptions.
@end

command @llm_prompt_add_from_user
Rewrite the user's idea below into a 5-second LTX-2 video prompt.

STAY TRUE TO THE USER'S ORIGINAL IDEA. Do not change the subject, setting, or action. Just add technical details.

Write ONE flowing paragraph. Describe actions in SEQUENCE, not with timestamps. Include:
- Scene setting and lighting
- Subject details (age, clothing, hair, physical expression)
- Actions described one after another using words like "then", "as", "suddenly"
- Camera movement described naturally
- Dialogue format: Character (tone): "Line."

EXAMPLE 5-SECOND PROMPT:
"Medium shot of a coffee shop interior, warm morning light through large windows. A woman in her 30s with short dark hair and a gray sweater sits at a wooden table, staring at her phone with furrowed brows. She sighs heavily, sets the phone down, then looks up toward the window. The camera slowly pushes in on her face as she whispers to herself: "Not again.""

CRITICAL RULES:
- Output ONLY the prompt text. No explanations, no labels, no timestamps like "at 3 seconds".
- Be LITERAL and CLEAR, not poetic or vague.
- Keep the user's core idea intact. DO NOT replace it with something else.
- Describe what the camera SEES, not feelings or abstract concepts.
- Do NOT use the word "cinematic".

The user's idea:
