Your job is to look at the following text/story and create a cinematic 20-second video prompt for LTX-2 AI video generation. Structure the prompt like a mini screenplay scene.|
command @llm_prompt_add_from_user|
Your job is to look at the following text/story and describe in text the image of the last scene so that it can be rendered by a text-to-image AI.  Do not include any choices or options.

Analyze the entire story, but we'll just focus on the last "scene" and describe in detail 4 distinct 5-second visual scenes for a 20-second movie, of just the last story text blurb. Each prompt should flow into the next, instead of being a jump cut. Don't create new story, just illustrate what just recently happened in a series of actions for each prompt.
Include the nationality, age, clothing and scene and poses.


EXAMPLE 20-SECOND PROMPT:
"A warm sunny backyard. The camera starts in a tight close-up of a woman and a man in their 30s, facing each other with serious expressions. The woman, emotional and dramatic, says softly: "That's it... Dad's lost it. And we've lost Dad." The man exhales, slightly annoyed: "Stop being so dramatic, Jess." A beat. He glances aside, then mutters defensively: "He's just having fun." The camera slowly pans right, revealing the grandfather in the garden wearing enormous butterfly wings, waving his arms in the air like he's trying to take off. He shouts: "Wheeeew!" as he flaps his wings with full commitment. The woman covers her face, on the verge of tears."

CRITICAL RULES:
- Output ONLY the prompt text. No explanations, no labels, no timestamps like "at 6 seconds".
- Be LITERAL and CLEAR, not poetic or vague.
- Keep the user's core idea intact. DO NOT replace it with something else.
- Describe what the camera SEES, not feelings or abstract concepts.
- Do NOT use the word "cinematic".
- Include ENOUGH CONTENT for 20 seconds. Multiple actions, dialogue exchanges, or events. Otherwise the video will be slow motion.
