## Download the latest version: V2.00 (Feb 25th, 2025) [AI Tools Client (Windows, 62 MB)](https://www.rtsoft.com/files/SethsAIToolsWindows.zip)

Need an old version? The last pre-V2 version (that still supports Auto1111) can be downloaded [here](https://www.rtsoft.com/files/SethsAIToolsWindowsV095.zip).

To use this, you'll need to connect to something that can generate images, and hopefully an LLM too.  A single OpenAI key is enough to do a lot (LLM and Dale3 rendering), you can also use Claude (via API key), or best yet, your own local ComfyUI server(s) and Ollama.

## Features

- It's not a web app, it's a native locally run Windows .exe
- It's kind of like lego, is can run ComfyUI workflows that chain together.  You need to understand ComyUI and workflow tweaking as you'll still need to install all the needed custom nodes and models there. (you do have ComfyUI Manager installed, right?!)
- Drag and drop images in as well as paste images from the windows clipboard
- Built-in image processing like cropping and resizing, mask painting
- Pan/zoom with thousands of images on the screen
- Built to utilize many ComfyUI servers at once
- Privacy respected - does not phone home or collect any statistics, purely local usage. (it does check a single file on github.com to check for newer versions, but that's it)
- Includes "experiments", little built-in games and apps designed to test AI
- AI Guide feature harnesses the power of AI to create motivational posters, illustrated stories or whatever
- Adventure mode has presets to various modes - generate ready to upload illustrated web quiz from prompt, simple Twine game project from a prompt, and "Adventure", a sort of illustrated AI Dungeon type of toy
- Includes presets and workflows for Flux, SDXL, Hunyuan, Wan 2.1, MMAudio, SAM2, BiRef
- By default strips<think> tags when continuing LLM work for Deepseek/thinking models
- For developers, using Unity and C# to do powerful things with AI instead of banging your head against the wall with ComfyUI workflows and python is pretty sweet
- You can drag in a bunch of pictures and have it turn them into tiny movies with sound.  How cool is that?

## Recent changes

- I ripped out the A1111 support, it's ComfyUI all the way now.  It's a big step and it broke things, so the paintball game and pizza thing are removed.  Most of the other things still work.  Crazy Camera sort of works, I fix it up later when I need it, it works using the new workflow/joblist system but it's too slow. I've versions to V2 to make it clear it's not the old version anymore.
- Introduces a whole new preset "joblist" system that strings together ComfyUI workflows, there are too many changes to list.  Making your own presets and worklows should be much simpler now.
- This project is entirely for fun, please pardon the lack of documentation and ease of use.  I'll try to help if you post problems here as issues or in the discussion area though!

## Known issues

- I suspect certain workflows won't work on Windows because I have a subdir in the model filename and the whole "/" vs "\\" thing rears its ugly head.  Why wouldn't ComfyUI fix those based on the system it's running on?  Anyway, you can either use a @replace to fix them in AITools, or edit the workflow's .json with a text editor, or drag the workflow into ComfyUI and edit the path there.  I only test on Windows, with the servers running on Ubuntu.
- Lack of documentation etc due to laziness
- CrazyCam (where the webcam is being used for realtime image processing) is half broken and slow
- Expect things to break and change, it's very alpha and probably always will be
- Probably a ton of bugs, I haven't tested it much
- The SDXL Inpainting ComfyUI workflow sometimes fails, tweaking the alpha mask fixes it, no idea what's up but it's not happening on my app's side
- The SAM2 based "select things by name" segmentation is pretty sketch, best I could find though.  Also, it can only select ONE thing in the image, I don't see a way to fix it without writing a custom node.  Use the including BiRef workflow instead if you can, it can only do "foreground" and "background" but it works much better in general.
- It can use all of OpenAI's APIs unless you set it to o1-mini, OpenAI doesn't like the format and gives an error.  gpt-4o and o3-mini work fine so whatever I guess.



You only need to download [the zip](https://www.rtsoft.com/files/SethsAIToolsWindows.zip) and run the .exe to use this, However, the source might be useful to generate a build for other platforms, fork or steal pieces to use for yourself.  Go ahead!

# Setup #

Your ComfyUI server needs to be started using the --listen parm, so the API can be accessed.  

After running it, a config.txt will be made. There is an config edit button inside the app, your config will look like this:

#add as many add_server commands as you want, just replace the localhost:7860 part with the
#server name/ip and port.  You can control any number of renderer servers at the same time.

#This is where you add rendering servers. (ComfyUI servers run with --listen parm)  For Dalle-3, don't set here, just enter your OpenAI key below.

#Uncomment below and put your renderer server.  Add more add_server commands to add as many as you want.  The second parm is
#an optional name so you can keep track of which server has which video card.
#add_server|http://localhost:7860|5090!|

#Set the below path and .exe to an image editor to use the Edit option. Changed files will auto
#update in here.

set_image_editor|C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop 2025\Photoshop.exe

#To generate text with the AI Guide features, you need at least one LLM. (or all, you can switch between them in the app)

#if you're using a ComfyUI workflow that creates audio, and you don't have AITOOLS_AUDIO_PROMPT or AITOOLS_AUDIO_NEGATIVE_PROMPT set in the ComfyUI workflow, these are used as defaults:
set_default_audio_prompt|audio that perfectly matches the onscreen action|
set_default_audio_negative_prompt|music|



# Setting up with ComfyUI (for FLUX images, Wan 2.1, Hunyuan video or any custom workflow)

First, install [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) and get it rendering stuff in Flux and/or Hunyuan using tutorials out there.

**Don't move on until it's working and you can generate images (Flux is good) and/or videos in ComfyUI directly**!

Next, just for a test to make sure the workflows included with AITools are going to work, inside ComfyUI's web GUI, drag in aitools_client/ComfyUI/FullWorkflowVersions/text_to_img_flux.json or any others.  The neat thing about ComfyUI is it will read this and convert it to its visual workflow format, ready to run.  (you might want to change the prompt from <AITOOLS_PROMPT> to something else during testing here) - Click Queue.  Does it work?  Oh, if you see an Image Loader set to the file "<AITOOLS_INPUT_1>" you'll need to change that to a file on your ComfyUI server if you want to test.

You'll probably see a bunch of red nodes and errors - no problem!  Make sure you have ComfyUI-Manager installed, you can use it to install any missing nodes.  You'll probably have to track down various model files though, but at least when you try to render it will shows exactly the filenames that are missing. (look for red boxes around certain nodes)

Adjust it until it works (change paths or models or whatever you need, you could even start with a totally different workflow you found somewhere else), and make sure the prompt is set to <AITOOLS_PROMPT>.  (<AITOOLS_NEGATIVE_PROMPT> can be used if your workflow has a place for that too)  Then do Workflow->Export (API) if you wanted to save your own.  Note:  **You need to have enabled "Dev mode" in the ComfyUI settings to see the "Export (API)" option.**

So you don't have to create custom workflows for every checkpoint/filesize etc, you can use AITools' "@replace" to change any part of a workflow before it's sent to ComfyUI's API.  You'll see it used in various presets.

Check discussions for some more info [here](https://github.com/SethRobinson/aitools_client/discussions/18)

# Building from source

- Requires Unity 6+
- Open the scene "Main" and click play to run
- Assets/GUI/GOTHIC.TFF and Assets/GUI/times.ttf are not included and might break the build because I was having trouble and switched some settings around that might require them now (dynamic vs static TMPro font settings...)
