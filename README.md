# Seth's AI Tools: An interactive Unity3D based Stable Diffusion front-end and testbed

License:  BSD style attribution, see LICENSE.md

There are two github respositories, one for the server, and one for the Unity client.

The docs/screenshots are in the [server repository](https://github.com/SethRobinson/aitools_server), not here!

Normal users just need to download the pre-built [Windows build](https://www.rtsoft.com/files/SethsAIToolsWindows.zip) anyway. 

However, this source might be useful to generate a build for other platforms, or fork or steal pieces to use for yourself.  Go ahead!

### How to use

* Requires Unity 2022.1.16+
* Open the scene "Main" and click play to run
