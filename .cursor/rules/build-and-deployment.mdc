# Build and Deployment Guide

## Build Scripts

### Windows Build
- Use [BuildWin64.bat](mdc:BuildWin64.bat) for Windows standalone builds
- Configure build settings in Unity Project Settings
- Handle version numbering and build dates
- Support both development and release builds

### WebGL Build
- Use [BuildWebGL.bat](mdc:BuildWebGL.bat) for web deployment
- Configure WebGL templates in `Assets/WebGLTemplates/`
- Handle asset optimization for web delivery
- Support different deployment targets

### Build Automation
- Use [BuildAndPlayWin64Game.bat](mdc:BuildAndPlayWin64Game.bat) for development workflow
- Implement [BuildAndUploadWebGL.bat](mdc:BuildAndUploadWebGL.bat) for deployment
- Handle build verification and testing
- Support automated version management

## Configuration Management

### Build Profiles
- Use Unity Build Profiles for different configurations
- Configure platform-specific settings
- Handle asset inclusion/exclusion
- Support development vs production builds

### Version Management
- Use [SetBuildDate.cs](mdc:Assets/_Script/SetBuildDate.cs) for version tracking
- Implement [RTBuildInfo.cs](mdc:Assets/_Script/RTBuildInfo.cs) for build information
- Handle version checking and updates via [UpdateChecker.cs](mdc:Assets/_Script/UpdateChecker.cs)
- Support beta and release channels
- Privacy-focused: no telemetry, only version checking

## Deployment Process

### Windows Distribution
- Package as standalone executable
- Include all required dependencies
- Handle installer creation and distribution
- Support automatic updates

### Web Deployment
- Optimize assets for web delivery
- Handle CDN distribution
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Support different hosting environments

### Package Management
- Use [Packages/manifest.json](mdc:Packages/manifest.json) for Unity packages
- Handle third-party dependencies
- Support package version management
- Implement proper package updates

## Development Workflow

### Local Development
- Use Unity Editor for development
- Implement hot reloading where possible
- Handle asset hot-swapping
- Support rapid iteration cycles

### Testing
- Implement automated testing where possible
- Handle different platform testing
