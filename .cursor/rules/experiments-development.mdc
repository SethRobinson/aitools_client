# Experiments Development Guide

## Experiment Structure

### Directory Organization
- Each experiment should have its own directory under `Assets/Experiments/`
- Include scripts, prefabs, audio, and assets in the experiment directory
- Use descriptive names: `ShootingGallery/`, `CrazyCam/`, `Adventure/`

### Core Components
- Create a main logic script for the experiment
- Use [BreakoutLogic.cs](mdc:Assets/Experiments/Breakout/BreakoutLogic.cs) as reference
- Implement proper cleanup and state management
- Handle integration with the main application

## AI Integration in Experiments

### Image Generation
- Use the main image generation pipeline from [PicMain.cs](mdc:Assets/_Script/Pic/PicMain.cs)
- Access AI services through the established managers
- Handle generation requests and responses properly
- Implement proper error handling for AI failures

### Real-time Processing
- Use [CrazyCamLogic.cs](mdc:Assets/Experiments/CrazyCam/CrazyCamLogic.cs) pattern for webcam processing
- Implement efficient frame capture and processing
- Handle different webcam resolutions and formats
- Manage processing pipeline performance

### Content Generation
- Use [AIGuideManager.cs](mdc:Assets/_Script/AIGuideManager.cs) for text generation
- Implement story generation for adventure games
- Handle quiz generation and validation
- Support multiple content types and formats

## Game Development Patterns

### Input Handling
- Use Unity's Input System for consistent input handling
- Support both mouse and keyboard input
- Implement proper input validation and filtering
- Handle input during AI processing delays

### Audio Integration
- Use [RTAudioManager.cs](mdc:Assets/RT/RTAudioManager.cs) for audio playback
- Support dynamic audio generation and playback
- Handle audio synchronization with visual elements
- Implement proper audio resource management

### Visual Effects
- Use Unity's particle system for effects
- Implement smooth transitions and animations
- Handle different screen resolutions and aspect ratios
- Optimize rendering for performance

## Experiment-Specific Patterns

### Shooting Gallery
- Use [ShootingGallery/](mdc:Assets/Experiments/ShootingGallery/) as reference
- Implement target spawning and management
- Handle collision detection and scoring
- Support different difficulty levels and modes

### Adventure Mode
- Use [Adventure/](mdc:Assets/Experiments/Adventure/) for story generation
- Implement Twine export functionality
- Handle branching story logic
- Support image generation for story scenes

### CrazyCam
- Implement real-time image processing
- Handle webcam input and output
- Manage processing pipeline performance
- Support different filter and effect modes

## Integration with Main Application

### State Management
- Communicate with main application state
- Handle experiment-specific settings
- Implement proper cleanup when switching experiments
- Preserve experiment state when possible

### Resource Management
- Use shared resources efficiently
- Handle memory management for large assets
- Implement proper resource cleanup
- Support resource preloading for performance

### Error Handling
- Handle AI service failures gracefully
- Provide user feedback for errors
- Implement fallback behaviors
- Log errors for debugging

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization
- Use object pooling for frequently created objects
- Implement efficient rendering for real-time applications
- Handle memory management for large image sets
- Optimize AI request batching

### Scalability
- Support different hardware capabilities
- Handle varying AI service response times
- Implement progressive loading for large content
- Support multiple simultaneous operations

## Testing and Debugging

### Development Tools
- Use Unity's debug tools for development
- Implement logging for AI interactions
- Create test scenarios for different conditions
- Support development vs production modes

### User Experience
- Provide clear instructions and feedback
- Handle loading states and transitions
- Implement proper error recovery
- Support accessibility features
