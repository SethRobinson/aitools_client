Example of the page format

IMAGE: (detailed description of the scene that will be sent to an AI image generator. , if people are in the scene, specify each person's age (in years old), clothing, ethnicity, expression, pose, colors, what they are holding, etc.  Don't assume any previous knowledge of the story or previous TEXT or IMAGE info, fully describe the scene and characters time. Don't bother with people's names unless they are well known/famous.  just one paragraph, no carriage returns)

NOTE:  Fully describe the IMAGE: tag each time, including age, ethnicity, etc

Create one TEXT and IMAGE pair.  Do not use text markdown styling of any kind, output only plain text.
