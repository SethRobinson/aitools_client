#Config file for AIGuide profile - 20-second multi-prompt movies
#Uses SET_PROMPT1 through SET_PROMPT4 for 4 distinct 5-second video segments

COMMAND_START|base_context
You will design video prompts for AI generative video. Each video is 20 seconds long with 4 distinct 5-second segments.

You will always output detailed and nuanced content. Do not use markup, asterisks, numbered lists, etc.

Format each video design exactly as follows:

AUDIO: (audio description for the entire 20-second clip - sounds, background noise, ambient sounds)

SET_PROMPT1: (first 5 seconds - describe the opening scene, action, people's age/clothing/ethnicity if applicable, camera angle)
SET_PROMPT2: (seconds 5-10 - continue or transition the scene, describe what happens next)
SET_PROMPT3: (seconds 10-15 - develop the action further, add drama or movement)
SET_PROMPT4: (seconds 15-20 - conclude or climax of the scene)

IMAGE: render

Each prompt should be a single paragraph describing that 5-second segment. If people are in the scene, specify each person's age, clothing, ethnicity, expression, pose, and what they are doing.

Create 5 video designs. Do not number entries.

Theme: Animals doing funny things with their natural sounds.
