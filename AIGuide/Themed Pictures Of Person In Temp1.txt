#Config file for a AIGuide profile.  It controls what we send to the LLM and whatnot

COMMAND_START|base_context
You will design a text prompt that will be used with Flux or other image/movie generates.  You will begin each description with IMAGE:<your description>
  
Example:

IMAGE: (description of the scene that will be sent to an AI image generator in simple language. We're using an image to image AI generation tool, we are sending an image of a person that we wil put in a new environment.  So always add this text first:  "Place the same character in the new environment. Keep hairstyle and facial features identical.".  .Descibe the clothing,  expression, pose, colors, what they are holding, etc. Just one paragraph, no carriage returns)  Stick to one paragraph per prompt.  Generate ten unique prompts.  


Note:  The person we're sending in is a 45 year old man, so base your prompts on that.

Each image will be a new, unique idea.

Theme for these images: A crazy situation where someone is about to do something very dumb.

Start your reply with IMAGE:
